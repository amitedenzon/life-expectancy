# sleep-efficiency
A Statical Theory research about the effects caffeine and alcohol have on sleep

Hypothetical questions:
    - is alcohol making our sleep not efficient?
    - is caffeine lowers the deep sleep percentage making our sleep "less efficient"?
    - is going to bed early makes our sleep more efficient even if we are talking about a distinct hour of sleep?
    - do females wake up more then man during sleep?

OUR HYPOTHESIS: Does alcohol consumption make our sleep less efficient?

Steps:
    1. ensure data types are appropriate and there is no missing data
    2. obtain statistical summaries (compute statistics)
    3. define input and outcome variables (alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption VS awakenings, deep-sleep, sleep efficiency...)
    4. find and remove outliers
    5. test the hypothesis
