# Life Expectancy

This project investigates the key factors that affect life expectancy, exploring variables like education, income composition, alcohol consumption, BMI, and HIV/AIDS prevalence. Our analysis leverages data science techniques to identify which of these features have the most significant impact on predicting life expectancy across different populations.

## Project Structure

#### 1. Dataset
The main dataset used in this project is saved as life-expectancy.csv. It contains various columns representing key features related to life expectancy, such as education, income, and health indicators. The dataset is crucial for understanding the relationships between these variables and life expectancy.

#### 2. Analysis Code
All code for this project, including the data analysis and model creation, is contained in the research.ipynb Jupyter notebook. This notebook walks through the preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.

## To run the analysis and view the results:

Clone the repository.

Open the research.ipynb notebook.

Ensure the life-expectancy.csv file is in the working directory.

Run all cells in the notebook to reproduce the results and insights.
