# Life Expectancy

This project's approach was to build a multivariate model to forecast life expectancy based on the most significant health-related features. With all relevant predictors under the significance threshold of 0.05, these findings emphasize the critical role of education and mostly economic well-being in fostering longer, healthier lives!

## Project Structure

#### 1. Dataset
The main dataset used in this project is saved as life-expectancy.csv. It contains various columns representing key features related to life expectancy, such as education, income, and health indicators. The dataset is crucial for understanding the relationships between these variables and life expectancy.

#### 2. Analysis Code
All code for this project, including the data analysis and model creation, is contained in the research.ipynb Jupyter notebook. This notebook walks through the preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.

## To run the analysis and view the results:

Clone the repository.

Open the research.ipynb notebook.

Ensure the life-expectancy.csv file is in the working directory.

Run all cells in the notebook to reproduce the results and insights.
